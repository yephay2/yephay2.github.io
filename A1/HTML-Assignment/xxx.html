        <h2>X's Early Life</h2>
            <p>Jahseh Dwayne Ricardo Onfroy was born on January 23, 1998, in Plantation, Florida, to Jamaican parents, Dwayne Ricardo Onfroy and Cleopatra Eretha Dreena Bernard. His father named him for the Bob Marley song "So Jah Seh" which interpolates Ezekiel 34. Both Onfroy's father and grandfather were Rastafarians. Onfroy stated he also had Egyptian or Syrian, Indian and possibly Italian ancestry in an interview on The Beat in 2017.
                Onfroy was mainly raised by his grandmother Collette Jones-due to his mother's personal problemsâ€”in Pompano Beach, Florida, and Lauderhill, Florida. When Onfroy was six years old, he allegedly tried to stab a man attempting to attack his motherand was eventually put into a youth program before living with his grandmother.A source close to the Onfroy family denied that the alleged stabbing incident occurred, and it could not be corroborated by police reports since Onfroy was a minor. In early 2008, when Onfroy was 10, his father was jailed for nine years in Arizona on RICO charges after the Drug Enforcement Administration organized a sting operation.Onfroy's father was deported to Jamaica in late 2016.
                Onfroy's interest in music initially started after his aunt persuaded him to begin attending school choir and later church choir. He was soon kicked out of the school choir after attacking another student.Onfroy attended Margate Middle School from which he was later expelled after a series of physical altercations. He was subsequently enrolled into Sheridan House Family Ministries by his mother for over six months. Onfroy began to listen to nu metal, hard rock and rap during his time at Sheridan House Family Ministries, which led to him learning how to play the piano and guitar.
                Onfroy attended Piper High School until he dropped out in the tenth grade. He described himself as a "misfit" during that time, citing how quiet he was despite being popular and regularly involved in physical confrontations. Onfroy was not the athletic type and said that he was insecure and depressed during his time in high school</p>
            <h2>X's Musical style and inspiration</h2>
            <p>XXXTentacion's music explored a wide variety of genres, including emo, trap, lo-fi, indie rock, punk rock, nu metal and hip hop. His influences included Kurt Cobain, whom he cited as his biggest inspiration,Cage the Elephant, Chingy, Coldplay, Eminem, The Fray, Chief Keef, Gorillaz, Hoobastank, Lana Del Rey, Laura Mvula, the Notorious B.I.G., Papa Roach, Yoko Shimomura, Tech N9ne, Tupac, Three Days Grace, The Weeknd, and Kanye West.</p>
            <h2>X's Attitude and  talents</h2>
            <p>XXXTentacion said, "I'm really into multi-genre things that aren't just based around rapping itself. I'm more inspired by artists in other genres besides rap."XXXTentacion as an artist has been defined as versatile and his music has been described as having a "lo-fi" aesthetic, being diverse and experimental, drawing influence from heavy metal. His music also has the tendency to contain distorted bass and an "intentional lack of polish".Speaking about this, XXXTentacion said that the intentionally bad mixing on his tracks make it "genuine"XXXTentacion generally changed his vocal style depending on the type of song he was performing on. His vocal style has been described as displaying "emotional vulnerability" on much more depressing tracksand as replicating screaming on much more aggressive tracks. His songwriting has been described as outlandish and shocking, often referring to "violence, sex, and drugs",though on some projects such as The Fall and 17, Onfroy's songwriting was more emotional in comparison to his previous work, often referring to loneliness, depression, isolation, and anxiety</p><hr>
